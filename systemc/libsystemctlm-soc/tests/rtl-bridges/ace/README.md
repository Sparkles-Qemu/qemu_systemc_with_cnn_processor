# ACE RTL Bridge test-suite

## Simulation

Two simulations tests are found in this directory, one excersing the ACE master
HW bridge (ace-mst-test) and a second exercising the ACE slave HW bridge
(ace-slv-test). Both tests start by running a specified traffic description (for
generating specific ACE transactions) through the bridges and continues with
running randomized traffic (resulting in randomized ACE transactions).

Both tests are hooked up to the py.test test-suite that runs from the
top of the project.

## VFIO tests

The two VFIO based tests found in the directory require a PCIe attached HW
Bridge with a specific memory map. An Open Source implementation of such a
design can be found here,
https://github.com/edgarigl/posh-rtl-bridges-refdesigns.

The first VFIO test in the directory runs on a HW configuration where an ACE
master HW bridge and an ACE slave HW bridge are connected in a loopbacked
fashion. A TLM ACE master is then used for running randomized ACE traffic
through the HW bridges. A second TLM ACE Master is also connected in the test
and is used for generating snoop traffic through the HW bridges (via the TLM ACE
interconnect). At the downstream port of the interconnect a TLM memory receives
the end memory transactions.

In the second test found in the directory the ACE slave bridge interacts and is
tested with ACE traffic generated by Xilinx System Cache IP. Similarly as above
a second TLM ACE master is used for generating snoop transactions towards the
System Cache and a TLM memory receives the end memory transactions.

## Running the VFIO tests

Please read the AXI HW bridge test [README.md](../axi/README.md) for a more
detailed explanation of how a system can be configured for VFIO use.

Below are sample command lines after configuring a system for VFIO use
(following above README) and programming the ACE bit-stream generated through
the git repository mention above onto a locally attached Xilinx Alveo u250.
These command lines might need minor modifications depending on which pci bus
the Alveo 250 device gets attached to.
